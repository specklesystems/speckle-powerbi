    Speckle Connector and 3D Visual for Power BI
</h3>

## Features

Speckle Power BI Data Connector lets you easily get data from Speckle into Power BI reports and visualizations. You can access and analyze data from various AEC apps (like Revit, Archicad, Grasshopper, and more) and open-source files (IFC, STL, OBJ, etc.) into Power BI with ease.

Speckle’s connection to Power BI consists of two parts:

- **Data Connector** fetches the data you uploaded from AEC apps to Speckle.
- **3D Visual** allows you to see those models in 3D within Power BI.

## Repository Structure

This repository is home to our Power BI connector. The Speckle Server provides all the web-facing functionality and can be found [here](https://github.com/specklesystems/Server).

`src/powerbi-data-connector` contains all the code for the Data connector.

`src/powerbi-visual` contains all the code for 3D Visual.

## Installation

Power BI connector installer can be downloaded from the [connectors portal](https://app.speckle.systems/connectors/). Full instructions for [installation](https://docs.speckle.systems/connectors/power-bi#setup) and [configuration](https://docs.speckle.systems/connectors/power-bi#why-dont-i-see-speckle-as-a-data-source-in-power-bi) can be found on our docs.

### 3D Visual

3D Visual can be imported as any other Power BI custom visual.

1. Navigate to the Visualization Pane.
2. Click the three dots (…) and select “Import a visual from a file”.
3. Go to `Documents/Power BI Desktop/Custom Visuals` and import `Speckle 3D Visual.pbiviz` file.
4. Speckle cube will appear in the Visualization pane.

For more on how to use the visual, [check our docs](https://docs.speckle.systems/connectors/power-bi).

## Quick Start

To get started with Power BI connector, please take a look at the [documentation](https://docs.speckle.systems/connectors/power-bi) and extensive [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@SpeckleSystems) published. 

## Development Setup

### For local development of the 3D Visual

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-powerbi.git
   cd speckle-powerbi
   ```

2. **Navigate to the visual directory**:
   ```bash
   cd src/powerbi-visual
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

4. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Build the visual**:
   ```bash
   # Development build
   npm run build:dev
   
   # Production build
   npm run build
   ```

### For local development of the Data Connector
