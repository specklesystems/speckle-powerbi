# Repo structure

This repo is the home to our Speckle 2.0 PowerBI project. The [Speckle Server](https://github.com/specklesystems/Server) is providing all the web-facing functionality and can be found [here](https://github.com/specklesystems/Server).

## Install

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-powerbi/releases) page, downlad the `.mez` file of the latest release and copy it into the following folder in your computer:

```
YOUR_USER_FOLDER\Documents\Power BI Desktop\Custom Connectors\
```

### Allow custom extensions to run

Go to `Settings -> Security -> Data Extensions` and activate the following option:

![Allow extensions to run](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2316535/130931149-074cf6a8-1910-41f1-99c7-b8b08168f473.png)

### Checking the connector is loaded

Now open PowerBI and you should see `Speckle (beta)` appear in the data source.

![PowerBI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2316535/129580913-02e5e662-f344-419c-9894-e97055930c58.png)

## Usage

> More detailed instructions on how to use the connector will be added shortly!

### Current limitations

Chunked data currently is not automatically de-chunked when received, we are aware of this limitation and are working to resolve it!

## Developing & Debugging

We encourage everyone interested to debug / hack / contribute / give feedback to this project.

### Setup

#### Install PowerQuery SDK

Follow the instructions from the [official docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/installingsdk)

#### Build with Visual Studio

Every time you build the connector, VisualStudio will copy the latest `.mez` connector file to the appropriate location. Just restart PowerBI to see the latest changes.

#### Debug

You can start the PowerQuery connector in VisualStudio, this will open a standalone connector you can use for testing purposes.

We don't know of a way to debug the connector live in PowerBI, but we'd be happy to hear about it.
